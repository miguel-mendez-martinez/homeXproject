Apart from all this that bootstrap and node generates, for having all the project you must npm install in the server and the client side so the node_modules are installed to your project. And for running all these i think we need 2 terminals, one for the client that will start the client with npm start and then in the server directory we will use nodemon server.js. In theory will all that it should be working.

Rigth now i dont know if all works and compiles, i'll try this week to create a base page that displays something from the database to let you know all is working. Right now its using mongodb, we have to decide a name for the database ad the project so we can add in .env the name of it and create in mongoCompass the database, each one should have one in his computer with the atributes we decide. 

In order to make it better ill try to connect to firebase but i cant promise anything until the end of the week when i end up my research.

This is just a sample, clone it to your computer and then we can do a repository for all of us with the archives you want, or use this one and change the name and stuff. 

I send this to you so if you want u start the frontend while we get all conected :D.

Thank you for the patience :3.
